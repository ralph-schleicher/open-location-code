OPEN-LOCATION-CODE

Open Location Code is a location encoding system for addresses,
independent of street names and building numbers.

See <https://plus.codes>.

                                                                      [Function]
validp (code)
   True if an object is a valid sequence of Open Location Code characters.

   Argument CODE is an object of any type.

   Value is ‘:full’ or ‘:short’ if CODE is a valid full or short Open
   Location Code respectively.  Otherwise, value is null.

                                                                      [Function]
fullp (code)
   True if an object is a valid full Open Location Code.

   Argument CODE is an object of any type.

   Value is true if CODE is a valid full Open Location Code.
   Otherwise, value is null.

                                                                      [Function]
shortp (code)
   True if an object is a valid short Open Location Code.

   Argument CODE is an object of any type.

   Value is true if CODE is a valid full Open Location Code.
   Otherwise, value is null.

                                                                      [Function]
encode (latitude longitude &optional (precision 5))
   Encode a location into an Open Location Code.

   First argument LATITUDE and second argument LONGITUDE denote the
    location in degree angle.  The latitude is clipped to the closed
    interval [-90, 90] and the longitude is normalized to the
    half-closed interval [-180, 180).
   Optional third argument PRECISION is the precision of the code.
    Default is five, i.e. a code length of ten digits.

   Value is a full Open Location Code (a string).

   The relation between precision, code length, and code area size
   is depicted in the following table.

      Precision  | Code Length |   Width / m   |  Height / m
    -------------+-------------+---------------+---------------
          1      |      2      | 2218929.9     | 2218929.9

          9      |     14      |       0.0542  |       0.0222
         10      |     15      |       0.0135  |       0.00444

   The code length is equal to the number of Open Location Code digits.
   Pad characters and the separator character ‘+’ are not part of the
   code length.  The code area dimensions are calculated with a mean
   earth radius of 6356766 m for a code area at the equator.

                                                                      [Function]
decode (code)
   Decode an Open Location Code.

   Argument CODE is an Open Location Code (a string).

   Primary value is a ‘code-area’ object.  Secondary value is ‘:full’ or
   ‘:short’ if CODE is a full or short Open Location Code respectively.
   If CODE is a full Open Location Code the code area denotes absolute
   coordinates.  Otherwise, the code area denotes relative coordinates,
   i.e. offset values in the enclosing block.

   Signal an ‘invalid-code-error’ if CODE is not a valid Open Location
   Code.

                                                                      [Function]
shorten (code latitude longitude)
   Remove four, six, or eight digits from the front of a full Open
   Location Code given a reference location.

   First argument CODE is a full Open Location Code (a string).
   Second argument LATITUDE and third argument LONGITUDE denote the
    reference location in degree angle.  The latitude is clipped to
    the closed interval [-90, 90] and the longitude is normalized to
    the half-closed interval [-180, 180).

   Value is the short code, or the original full code if the reference
   location is too far.

   Signal a ‘full-code-error’ if CODE is not a full Open Location Code.

                                                                      [Function]
recover (code latitude longitude)
   Recover a full Open Location Code from a short code
   and a reference location.

   First argument CODE is an Open Location Code (a string).
   Second argument LATITUDE and third argument LONGITUDE denote the
    reference location in degree angle.  The latitude is clipped to
    the closed interval [-90, 90] and the longitude is normalized to
    the half-closed interval [-180, 180).

   Value is the recovered full code.  If CODE is already a full code,
   return CODE as is.

   Signal an ‘invalid-code-error’ if CODE is not an Open Location
   Code.

                                                                     [Condition]
