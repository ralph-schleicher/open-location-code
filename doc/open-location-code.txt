OPEN-LOCATION-CODE

Open Location Code is a location encoding system for addresses,
independent of street names and building numbers.  The encoded
location identifier is called Plus Code since it always contains
a plus sign character.  For example, 8FX8QJ2G+QH is the Plus Code
of the Roman bridge in Trier, Germany.

                                                                      [Function]
validp (code)
   True if an object is a valid sequence of Plus Code characters.

   Argument CODE is an object of any type.

   Value is ‘:full’ or ‘:short’ if CODE is a valid full or short Plus
   Code respectively.  Otherwise, value is null.

                                                                      [Function]
fullp (code)
   True if an object is a valid full Plus Code.

   Argument CODE is an object of any type.

   Value is true if CODE is a valid full Plus Code.
   Otherwise, value is null.

                                                                      [Function]
shortp (code)
   True if an object is a valid short Plus Code.

   Argument CODE is an object of any type.

   Value is true if CODE is a valid full Plus Code.
   Otherwise, value is null.

                                                                      [Function]
encode (latitude longitude &optional precision)
   Encode a location into a Plus Code.

   First argument LATITUDE and second argument LONGITUDE denote the
    location in degree angle.  The latitude is clipped to the closed
    interval [-90, 90] and the longitude is normalized to the
    half-closed interval [-180, 180).
   Optional third argument PRECISION is the precision of the code.
    Default is five, i.e. a code length of ten digits.

   Value is a full Plus Code (a string).

   The relation between precision, code length, and code area size
   is depicted in the following table.

      Precision  | Code Length |   Width / m   |  Height / m
    -------------+-------------+---------------+---------------
          1      |      2      | 2218929.9     | 2218929.9

          7      |     12      |       0.867   |       0.555
          8      |     13      |       0.217   |       0.111
          9      |     14      |       0.0542  |       0.0222
         10      |     15      |       0.0135  |       0.00444

   The code length is equal to the number of Plus Code digits.  Pad
   characters and the separator character ‘+’ are not part of the code
   length.  The code area dimensions are calculated with a mean earth
   radius of 6356766 m for a code area at the equator.

                                                                      [Function]
decode (code)
   Decode a Plus Code.

   Argument CODE is a Plus Code (a string).

   Primary value is a ‘code-area’ object.  Secondary value is ‘:full’
   or ‘:short’ if CODE is a full or short Plus Code respectively.  If
   CODE is a full Plus Code the code area denotes absolute coordinates.
   Otherwise, the code area denotes relative coordinates, i.e. offset
   values in the enclosing block.

   Signal an ‘invalid-code-error’ if CODE is not a valid Plus Code.

                                                                      [Function]
shorten (code latitude longitude)
   Remove four, six, or eight digits from the front of a full Plus
   Code given a reference location.

   First argument CODE is a full Plus Code (a string).
   Second argument LATITUDE and third argument LONGITUDE denote the
    reference location in degree angle.  The latitude is clipped to
    the closed interval [-90, 90] and the longitude is normalized to
    the half-closed interval [-180, 180).

   Value is the short code, or the original full code if the reference
   location is too far.

   Signal a ‘full-code-error’ if CODE is not a full Plus Code.

                                                                      [Function]
recover (code latitude longitude)
   Recover a full Plus Code from a short code and a reference location.

   First argument CODE is a Plus Code (a string).
   Second argument LATITUDE and third argument LONGITUDE denote the
    reference location in degree angle.  The latitude is clipped to
    the closed interval [-90, 90] and the longitude is normalized to
    the half-closed interval [-180, 180).

   Value is the recovered full code.  If CODE is already a full code,
   return CODE as is.

   Signal an ‘invalid-code-error’ if CODE is not a Plus Code.

                                                                     [Condition]
